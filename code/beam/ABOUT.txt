This directory contains the necessary Python scripts to run 
a reliability-based design optimization for the cantilevered
beam problem. Reliabilities are estimated via Monte Carlo
sampling and different methods of including margin are 
available: MC+PI, MC+BV, MC+MD LDM, MC+MIP LDM

Files:
batch.py: script which can be used to run optimizations in batch
  and save information for a selected margin approach. The user
  can change optimization, reliability analysis properties in 
  the main() function. The margin approach used is specified on
  line 220 in f_list.
optimize.py: script which contains necessary functions for 
  running an optimization with various types of margin
beam.py: script which contains functions unique to the canti-
  levered beam problem
plotCompare.py: script which plots data from various margin
  approaches after optimizations have been run
  
Folders:
optimization_results: contains data for optimizations using the 
  plug-in approach, basis value approach, MIL LDM approach, 
  and MIL MIP approach for sample counts of 100 and 1000.
results: contains subfolders with sweeps through sample counts
  for each of the four approaches
